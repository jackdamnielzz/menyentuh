# Active Context

## Current Work
- Moved site files from `src/` to the repository root (HTML, css, assets, js, 404/robots/sitemap).
- Updated documentation paths to match the new root-level structure.

## Next Steps
- Verify content accuracy (contact details, pricing, opening hours).
- Optional: add real booking integration if required later.
